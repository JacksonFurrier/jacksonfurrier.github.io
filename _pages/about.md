A GPU enthusiast, OpenCL grown then CUDA and Slang coder. I've interested myself throughout the years with various research projects, including gravitational wave search, microbiological image analysis and finally with nuclear imaging. 

My current focus is on developing algorithms for different probelms during the [myocardial perfusion imaing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_perfusion_imaging) [SPECT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-photon_emission_computed_tomography) protocol. I've focused on various issues involving motion estimation, reconstruction, segmentation and reorentation. During these problems I have mostly programmed in `C++`, `CUDA`, `Python`, `GLSL`, `Docker`, `CMake`, `GCN, RDNA3 ASM`. For graphics I have been focusing on `Vulkan`.
