In clinical practice, regional myocardial perfusion is often measured with a gamma camera and quantified via circumferential profile analysis. Normal reference profile data is used to increase the accuracy of the clinical interpretations. Our goal is to create reference data from an existing set of archived studies. An iterative mathematical method, based on two statistical hypotheses, was used to generate the study set instead of collecting normal examinations from a healthy population. Clinical validation is based on interpretations by six independent observers. Results of evaluation with synthesized normal data and its validation are presented.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="task">Task</h2> <p>Develop a method based on [1], [2] which can generate normal data from a reference dataset of ill-conditioned patients.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="references">References</h2> <p>[1] <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1175084&amp;casa_token=YDjkMXjuuUgAAAAA:V-1R4nhJLftTOlbcZwyMXq9BCxbanE9vAN7ub3sZUx4yyxrVxyS0tT0SjUxWSkn75PHHSMHNabhVqw">Mathematical generation of normal data for evaluating myocardial perfusion studies</a>, Marianna et. al.</p> <p>[2] Osszehasonlito adatok eloallitasa bull’s-eye kepek ertekelesehez, Mate et. a.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="contact">Contact</h2> <p>szaqaei@inf.elte.hu, kari.bela@semmelweis.hu</p>]]></content><author><name>Adam Istvan szucs</name></author><category term="distill"/><category term="formatting"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Generating normal databases from non-healthy patients]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Motion correction of Multi-pinhole (MPH) projection frames with metamorphosis</title><link href="https://jacksonfurrier.github.io/blog/2025/mc_metamorph/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Motion correction of Multi-pinhole (MPH) projection frames with metamorphosis"/><published>2025-02-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-02-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jacksonfurrier.github.io/blog/2025/mc_metamorph</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jacksonfurrier.github.io/blog/2025/mc_metamorph/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="topic">Topic</h2> <p>Various functional imaging cameras are specialized to acquire the biochemical processes in a time and space-dependent way of different organs in-vivo. The main properties of functional imaging are relatively low resolution and high sensitivity to be manifested in multiple collimation and detection strategies. As a result, the projection geometry in each multi-vendor camera has large variability, making the inherent and acquired imaging artifacts hard to handle by algorithms. A theoretical methodology is developed to overcome one of the biggest effects of acquired imperfection, the patient’s motion which interferes with the heart’s motion. It is well known that, the different motion influences may alter the crucial quantitative measures. These are rendered as the main important issues of functional imaging. Solutions exist by multiple commercial approaches already, but only for specific collimation geometries. This motivation inspired the development of an automatic optimization method to overcome the above-mentioned motion artifact with general collimation geometry on the complete detector field-of-view (FOV). The theory (geo mc) is based on a metamorphic control problem with Optimal Transport (OT) augmentation to overcome the problems introduced by the acquired artifacts and intrinsic imaging system. The algorithm is designed on multi-pinhole (MPH) and low energy high resolution (LEHR) collimation with promising a great improvement over Optial Flow (OF) methods. The aim is to further lower the error in total perfusion deficit (TPD) scores for practical ability to apply on the patient Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) studies as well. Conclusion: A geometry invariant global optimization technique with nonrigid displacement correction is shown and designed on multiple projection acquisitions. Further application on phantom studies and later patient applicability looks promising for 4 dimensional protocols too.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="task">Task</h2> <p>Develop the <a href="https://github.com/JacksonFurrier/ieee_bibm_2024_code">technique</a> further, based on [1], [2] to get better results on MPH apertures with motion phenomena.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="references">References</h2> <p>[1] <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/BIBM62325.2024.10822170">Projection geometry invariant nonrigid motion correction</a>, Adam et. al.</p> <p>[2] <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/GPMC48183.2019.9106957">Automated non-linear motion detection and estimation for MPI SPECT</a>, Adam et. al.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="contact">Contact</h2> <p>szaqaei@inf.elte.hu</p>]]></content><author><name>Adam Istvan szucs</name></author><category term="distill"/><category term="formatting"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Non-linear and projective geometry based motion detection and correction]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Monte carlo-based reconstruction method for MPH collimators</title><link href="https://jacksonfurrier.github.io/blog/2025/rec_mc_torch/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Monte carlo-based reconstruction method for MPH collimators"/><published>2025-02-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-02-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jacksonfurrier.github.io/blog/2025/rec_mc_torch</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jacksonfurrier.github.io/blog/2025/rec_mc_torch/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="topic">Topic</h2> <p>TODO</p> <hr/> <h2 id="task">Task</h2> <p>TODO</p> <hr/> <h2 id="references">References</h2> <p>[1] <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/9781351074834/monte-carlo-particle-transport-methods-lux">Monte Carlo Particle Transport Methods</a>, Ivan L. et. al.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="contact">Contact</h2> <p>szaqaei@inf.elte.hu</p>]]></content><author><name>Adam Istvan szucs</name></author><category term="distill"/><category term="formatting"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dynamic acquisition oriented monte carlo simulation of gamma-photon transport]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Optimization methods in left ventricle segmentation</title><link href="https://jacksonfurrier.github.io/blog/2025/seg_lv_optim/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Optimization methods in left ventricle segmentation"/><published>2025-02-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-02-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jacksonfurrier.github.io/blog/2025/seg_lv_optim</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jacksonfurrier.github.io/blog/2025/seg_lv_optim/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="topic">Topic</h2> <p>Image segmentation is a day-to-day task of clinical practitioners to carry out volume/area/surface specific quantities of a region of interest (ROI). In most cases this task can be challenging and too long to solve (multiple hours/half an hour), therefore some level of automation is needed.</p> <p>There are many segmentation methodologies based on different theories, but in most of the cases these are not applied in the practice due to the unacceptable running times. Besides deep-learning the graph-based algorithms are actively being researched and developed. [1] The data being volumetric (3D scalar field) it can be represented as a large graph with nodes being voxels and edges being the connection between neighboring (e.g. 6 neighboring cubes) voxels. With this abstraction, a segmentation task can be thought as a graph partitioning/slicing method to find the desired ROI (e.g. a liver in a CT dataset, thyroids in a SPECT dataset).</p> <p>The graph-based algorithms are often developed in hand with variational image segmentation methods to define an energy which can be minimized on the graph. Sometimes this approach can lead to long running times and complicated optimization tactics. A different approach was introduced in [2] to overcome the drawbacks of the latter. The method is fast and accurate in the segmentation task with a simple isoperimetric cost function. Even though it is fast and accurate solving the isoperimetric problem for instance in most cases this wont suffice (e.g.: full body bone segmentation)</p> <p>Problem with graph-based methods is metrication bias, which renders as low resolution or high computation times. To overcome the aforementioned problem, a continuous optimization [3, 4] can be applied to handle the discrete resolution of graph-based methods. The continuous max-flow (CMF) method is very accurate in classification problems.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="task">Task</h2> <p>Investigate and develop a technique based-on CMF method with shape priors to handle the “few-shot” learning with classical methods. Compare the current method to the competing ones (given by the topic supervisor). Investigate shape descriptors in a statistical setting and compare it to self-supervised methods.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="references">References</h2> <p>[1] <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1580491&amp;casa_token=HD-uw-azqYMAAAAA:cH4e-44fUMcIBPhLoWQNS3LhmNm9Jwyt0QZNWtaQtyecIxaO_Z7ql3jxohmFVrX7KWK34Ca8Dy8OwQ&amp;tag=1">Isoperimetric Graph Partitioning for Image Segmentation</a>, Leo Grady, Eric L.

To quantitatively measure myocardial function, clinicians depend on commercially available solutions to segment and reorient the left ventricle (LV) for evaluation. Based on large normal datasets, the segmentation performance and the high price of these solutions can hinder the availability of reliable and precise localization of the LV delineation. To overcome the aforementioned shortcomings this paper aims to give a recipe for diagnostic centers as well as for clinics to automatically segment the myocardium based on small and low-quality labels on reconstructed SPECT, complete field-of-view (FOV) volumes.</p> <p>A self-supervised learning (SSL) approach was developed in [1] with convolutional neural networks (CNN). The technique was based on jigsaw puzzle as a pretext task and supervision on 5 patients as fine-tuning. The method reached good performance on various metrics, however on hypoperfused myocardium it wasn’t able to get acceptable results. A way to enhance the technique is to apply methods from Vision transformers (ViT) on some parts of the architecture and training as well [2]. Furthermore the incorporation of shape information about left ventricles can raise the performance of such methods.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="task">Task</h2> <p>Develop a ViT-based SSL few-shot learning method and investigate the incorporation of shape information in the optimization process.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="references">References</h2> <p>[1] <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3632047.3632078">Self-supervised segmentation of myocardial perfusion imaging SPECT left ventricles</a>, Adam et al.</p> <p>[2] <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482523004195?casa_token=T2dI_3cEndIAAAAA:kPV9wHN_07raKCy6hzW_5CJfFA0AjxmV9yXDoZg6o8l2Z7dKvwGKFE27_pJRpPov6sG2tjsAE-c">A new method incorporating deep learning with shape priors for left ventricular segmentation in myocardial perfusion SPECT images</a>, Fubau et al.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="contact">Contact</h2> <p>szaqaei@inf.elte.hu</p>]]></content><author><name>Adam Istvan szucs</name></author><category term="distill"/><category term="formatting"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Problems with low labeled left ventricle segmentation in MPI SPECT]]></summary></entry></feed>
